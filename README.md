# MDD

## Description
MDD is an app used to explore complex parametric relationships in higher dimensional data. The user defines the parameters (dependent variables)
that their data/measurements depends on, then uploads their data as .csv files. The user can then visualize their data by graphing the results 
in a dynamic grid while easily slicing and switching between parameters. As well, the user will be able to analyze their data through techniques
such as linear regression, performing derivatives, and performing FFTs. Finally, missing data will be able to be predicted using machine learning 
techniques.
