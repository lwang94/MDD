# MDD

## Description
MDD is an app used to explore complex parametric relationships in higher dimensional data. The user defines the parameters (independent variables)
that their data/measurements depends on, then uploads their data (dependent variables) as .csv files. The user can then visualize their data by graphing the results 
in a dynamic grid while easily slicing and switching between parameters. As well, the user can analyze their data through techniques
such as performing derivatives and fitting using least squares regression. Future features inclues FFT, predictions using machine learning techniques, and 3D graphs.
